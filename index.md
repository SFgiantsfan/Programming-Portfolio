## Java Projects

### Shape Tester
Command line application that lets you input the information for a 3D shape and then it gives you the volume and surface area for the shape. The three shapes it does are box, sphere, and pyramids.

## Individual Projects
### MLB Stadium Tracker & Game!
This app has two different functions: Stadium Tracker, and Team Name Guesser. In the stadium tracker you can store information about MLB stadiums you have been to. In the Team Name Guesser you get to play a game and guess an MLB team based on information displayed.

### Shape Tester
This is a command line app that calculates the volume and surface area of three different shapes. It calculates these things for cubes, spheres, and prisms. When you start the app it asks you for the required information and then calculates the volume and surface area. For example, on a cube, it will ask for the length, width, and height.

### IO Challenge
This app reads from an input file, prints it to the console, and the saves it to an output file.

### Code a Cipher
This cipher takes a message from an input file and encrypts it. The encryption moves the letters 5 down the alphabet and then puts the new words backwards. For example, the word "happy" would become duufm. It then saves the encrypted word to a different file.

### Multidimensional Arrays (Multiplication Table)
This app uses multidimensional arrays and a for loop to print a multiplication table to the console.
